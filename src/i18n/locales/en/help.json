(4) Copy the Application (client) ID from the Overview page. (5) Go to API permissions → Add a permission → Microsoft Graph → Delegated permissions → add: offline_access, email, openid, profile, User.Read. If you can find 'Office 365 Exchange Online' under 'APIs my organization uses', add IMAP.AccessAsUser.All and SMTP.Send from there too. If not, add them via Manifest JSON (see tips). (6) Go to Authentication (left sidebar) → scroll to 'Advanced settings' → set 'Allow public client flows' to Yes → Save. (7) In the app, choose Add IMAP Account, enter your personal Outlook email, paste the Client ID, leave Client Secret blank, and click 'Sign in with Microsoft'. Server settings are auto-filled (IMAP: imap-mail.outlook.com:993 SSL, SMTP: smtp-mail.outlook.com:587 STARTTLS).
